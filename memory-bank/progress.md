# Project Progress

## What Works

- Project workspace initialized.
- Defined Project Structure (including dedicated `src/editor/` directory).
- Core Entities Defined (`src/entities/` contains Player, Platforms, Enemies, Crates, Barrels, FinishLine, etc.).
- Agreed Level Data Format (JSON).
- **Level Editor Basics:**
  - Separate editor launch via `pnpm run editor`.
  - `EditorScene` implemented with camera controls (pan/zoom) and graphics-based grid.
  - UI Components (`Palette`, `Inspector`, `Toolbar`) created and integrated.
  - Entity placement (snapped to grid).
  - Entity selection with visual feedback.
  - Property inspection and editing via `Inspector` (Platform properties editable, Enemy type read-only).
  - **Platform Handling:**
    - Platforms created using the actual `Platform` class.
    - `segmentCount` and `isVertical` modification supported (recreates platform).
  - **Enemy Handling:**
    - Separate placement of `EnemyLarge` and `EnemySmall` using their classes.
    - Fixed EnemyLarge and EnemySmall classes to include required 'type' property.
  - Level Save/Load functionality implemented using JSON format (saves/loads specific enemy types).
  - **Entity Data:**
    - Fixed entity interface implementations to include all required properties.
    - Different interfaces have different requirements:
      - `PlatformInterface`: Requires `scene`, `id`, `x`, `y`, `segmentCount`, `isVertical`
      - `EnemyInterface`: Only requires `x`, `y`, `type` (no `scene` property)
      - `CrateInterface`: Requires `scene`, `x`, `y`, `type`
      - `BarrelInterface`: Requires `scene`, `x`, `y`
      - `FinishLineInterface`: Requires `scene`, `x`, `y`
  - **Level Data Management:**
    - Improved serialization/deserialization with separate interfaces to avoid circular references.
    - Created `SerializedPlatform`, `SerializedEnemy`, etc. interfaces for JSON storage.
    - Properly handles non-serializable properties like `scene` during save/load.
  - **Code Cleanup:**
    - Fixed unused variable warnings in EditorScene.ts
    - Properly handled event parameters in wheel and pointer events
    - Removed unused entityDragStartX and entityDragStartY variables

## What's Left to Build

- **Game Integration:**
  - Modify the `Game.ts` scene to load levels from the editor's JSON format.
  - Remove all procedural generation code (`LevelGenerator.ts` likely removed or heavily repurposed).
  - Instantiate entities (Platforms, Enemies, Items) based on loaded JSON data, including correct enemy types.
  - Repurpose `LevelGenerator.ts` to _only_ handle coin placement. Modify its logic to place coins on loaded platforms, skipping platforms that contain enemies or crates based on the loaded JSON data.
  - Ensure death zones, crate respawning, etc., work correctly with loaded levels.
- **Editor Refinements:**
  - Implement object dragging/movement for selected entities.
  - Consider Undo/Redo functionality.
  - Improve Inspector UI (e.g., enable enemy type changing - requires recreation).
  - Add visual validation or feedback (e.g., if trying to place overlapping objects).
- **Testing:**
  - Test editor functionality thoroughly (placement, selection, properties, save/load).
  - Test game playing various levels created with the editor (once integration is done).
- **Game Mechanics Adaptation:**
  - Adapt existing game mechanics (Player movement, Physics, Restart Flow, Death Zones) to work seamlessly with manually loaded levels.
- **Clean up remaining compiler errors:**
  - Fix `src/editor/ui/Inspector.ts` unused createTextInput method
  - Fix `src/lib/level-generation/LevelGenerator.ts` missing/unused CrateSmall import
  - Fix `src/scenes/Game.ts` non-existent CrateBig import

## Current Status

- **Level Editor core functionality implemented.**
- Editor uses actual game entity classes (`Platform`, `EnemyLarge`, `EnemySmall`) for placement and rendering.
- Save/Load functionality for level JSON is operational, including specific enemy types.
- Focus shifting towards integrating the editor output into the main game and refining the editor.
- Previous work on procedural level generation remains **deprecated**.
- **Fixed linter errors** related to entity interfaces and entity creation in the editor.
- Discovered that interfaces have different property requirements:
  - `EnemyInterface` doesn't require a `scene` property unlike other entity interfaces.
- **Improved serialization** for level data by creating separate interfaces that don't include circular references.
- **Fixed Enemy classes** by adding the required 'type' property to match the EnemyInterface.
- **Code cleanup** resolved unused variable warnings in EditorScene.ts.

## Known Issues

- Entity dragging/movement in the editor is not yet implemented.
- Platform property changes cause a full recreation, potentially losing instance-specific state if any existed (currently none).
- Changing Enemy type via Inspector is not yet implemented (requires recreation logic).
- There are still a few TypeScript compiler errors in files outside of EditorScene.ts that need to be addressed.

## Evolution of Decisions

- **Major Pivot:** Shifted from procedural level generation to a manual level editor as the primary method for creating game content.
- **JSON Data Format:** Defined a specific JSON structure for storing level data.
- **Code Structure:** Introduced a dedicated `src/editor/` directory.
- **Retained Mechanics:** Core gameplay systems (physics, controls, restart) will be adapted for manually designed levels.
- **Editor Grid:** Implemented using Phaser Graphics API instead of image assets.
- **Platform Implementation:** Refactored editor to use the actual `Platform` entity class instead of manual rendering or ghosts, improving consistency with the game.
- **Enemy Implementation:** Refactored editor to differentiate and use `EnemyLarge` and `EnemySmall` classes.
- **Entity Data Consistency:** Ensured all entity data objects include all required properties from their respective interfaces, noting the differences between interfaces.
- **Serialization Strategy:** Created dedicated interfaces for serialized data to avoid circular references and properly handle instance reconstruction.
- **Code Quality:** Improved TypeScript compliance by fixing linter errors and unused variables.
