# Project Brief: Phaser Platformer Game

## Core Requirements and Goals

Develop a responsive Phaser 3 platformer game utilizing the Matter.js physics engine. The game features procedural level generation, mobile controls, and various gameplay mechanics like wall jumping (assisted by crates), barrel interaction, and dynamic death zones.

## Scope

- Procedural level generation with increasing difficulty.
- Player movement (walk, jump) and interactions (crates, barrels, enemies, coins).
- Physics-based interactions using Matter.js.
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile (with touch controls).
- Dynamic elements: Respawning crates, multiple death zones.
- Core gameplay loop: Level progression, restart mechanics.
