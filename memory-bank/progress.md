# Project Progress

## What Works

- Project workspace initialized.
- Defined Project Structure (Standard Phaser/TS/Vite conventions).
- Mobile Responsiveness and UI Scaling:
  - Game scales correctly using `EXPAND` mode.
  - UI elements adapt to different screen sizes.
  - Mobile touch controls are implemented and functional.
- Conditional Game Initialization:
  - Game only initializes and runs in landscape orientation.
- Asset Naming Convention Applied (Player Wobble).
- Barrel Placement Logic (Mandatory Substitution & Optional Placement) Implemented and Tested.
- Enemy Placement Restriction (Level 1, First 2 Platforms) Implemented.
- Player-Barrel Interaction Logic (Collision Detection, Player State) Implemented.
- Improved Platform Visibility (Reduced Max Y Distance).
- Immediate Game Start (No Click-to-Play).
- Level Generation Enhancements:
  - Vertical walls (using rotated platforms) implemented at the end of platforms to help reach higher platforms.
  - Wall placement algorithm improved with correct positioning and height calculations.
  - Barrel substitution for impassable gaps refined.
  - Strategic crate placement specifically near walls based on jump necessity.
  - Crate generation improved: Strategic placement near walls uses randomness for type selection (small/big), and additional random crates are scattered on eligible platforms for variety, ensuring both crate types are used.
  - Debug visualization for wall and crate placement.
- Cool landing animation for level completion implemented.
- Player sprite rendered in front of finish line (proper depth sorting).
- Increased enemy density and level length for greater challenge.
- Corrected Coin Placement:
  - No coins on the initial platform.
  - `MIN_COIN_SPACING` is strictly enforced.
  - Coins placed evenly without gaps.
- Keyboard controls (Space/Enter) for restarting level are implemented.
- Conditional landing animation logic ('fx_land' suppressed when coin collected) implemented.
- Gameplay Enhancements (Based on Feedback):
  - Single-input restart (dismiss + auto-restart after delay) implemented.
  - Multiple dynamic death zones (500px below platforms) implemented.
  - Box respawning on restart implemented.
  - Crate destruction in death zones implemented.

## What's Left to Build

- The entire editor application.
- Asset organization and processing pipelines.

## Current Status

- All gameplay enhancements have been completed. The core game now runs well with all requested features.
- Ready to move on to developing the editor application (original project goal).

## Known Issues

- None identified. (Resolved unused import warning for CrateSmall).

## Evolution of Decisions

- Initial decision made to standardize asset naming conventions (lowercase, hyphens).
- Evolution of level generation strategy: from randomly placed vertical walls to strategically positioned walls at platform edges, improving navigation and game flow.
- Evolution of crate placement: from random placement to strategic positioning specifically near walls to help players climb.
- Evolution of crate placement: from random placement to strategic positioning near walls (based on height + randomness) and additional random placement elsewhere to ensure variety and utility.
- Addition of debug visualization to verify correct object placement during level generation.
- Enhanced difficulty curve by increasing enemy density and level length, providing a more challenging experience while maintaining playability.
- Refined coin placement logic to prevent placement on the initial platform and ensure consistent spacing.
- Simplified game flow with automatic level restart after death/level completion, eliminating the need for explicit player action to restart.
