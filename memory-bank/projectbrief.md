# Project Brief: Phaser Matter Physics Editor

## Core Requirements and Goals

Develop an editor application to facilitate the creation and configuration of physics objects and scenes for Phaser games utilizing the Matter.js physics engine. The editor should provide a visual interface for manipulating physics properties, shapes, constraints, and potentially exporting configurations usable within a Phaser project.

## Scope

- Visual editing of Matter.js bodies (shapes, position, properties like mass, friction, restitution).
- Configuration of Matter.js constraints.
- Scene management (adding/removing bodies).
- Exporting scene/object configurations in a format suitable for Phaser.
- (Initial scope, may evolve)
