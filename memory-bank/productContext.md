# Product Context

**Problem:** Lack of a simple, engaging 2D platformer example built with Phaser and Matter.js demonstrating core mechanics and effects.

**Solution:** Develop a game featuring a player character navigating levels, collecting items, and interacting with the environment, showcasing common platformer features and visual feedback like landing effects.

**User Experience:**

- Intuitive controls (keyboard/potentially mobile).
- Clear visual feedback for player actions (movement, jumping, landing).
- Satisfying collection mechanics.
- Smooth performance.
- Engaging barrel mechanic: Player can enter barrels and be launched in a specific direction, adding a new layer of traversal and puzzle potential.
