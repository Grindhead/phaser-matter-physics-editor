# Project Brief

This project is a 2D platformer game built using Phaser and Matter.js physics. The core mechanic involves a player character navigating levels, potentially using interactive elements like barrels.

**Core Goal:** Create a 2D platformer game using Phaser and Matter.js physics.

**Key Features:**

- Player character with standard platformer controls (walk, jump).
- Collectible items.
- Simple enemies.
- Level progression.
- Physics-based interactions.
- Visual effects (FX) for player actions.
- Donkey Kong Country-style barrels (enter, launch).
