# Project Progress

## What Works

- Project workspace initialized.

## What's Left to Build

- The entire editor application.
- Asset organization and processing pipelines.
- Implement conditional game initialization based on screen orientation.
- **Level Generation Enhancements:**
  - Vertical walls (using rotated platforms).
  - Barrel substitution for impassable gaps.
- **Gameplay Enhancements (Based on Feedback):**
  - Keyboard restart (Space/Enter).
  - Single-input restart (dismiss + start).
  - Post-obstacle "safe zone".
  - Improved platform visibility (adjust max Y distance).
  - Box respawning on restart.
  - Higher death colliders (reduce fall time).
  - Enemy difficulty curve refinement (smaller enemies first).
  - Level completion "cool landing" animation implementation.
  - Player/Finish line depth sorting implementation.
  - Enemy placement restriction for first two platforms (level 1).

## Current Status

- Project initiation phase.
- First task: Renaming assets in `/assets/player/wobble/`.

## Known Issues

## Evolution of Decisions
