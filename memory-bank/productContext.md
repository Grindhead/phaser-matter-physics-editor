# Product Context

## Problem Solved

Manually configuring Matter.js physics in Phaser code can be tedious, error-prone, and lacks visual feedback. This editor aims to simplify this process, allowing developers and designers to visually create and tweak physics interactions.

## How It Works (Vision)

Users will interact with a graphical interface representing the Phaser/Matter.js scene. They can add predefined shapes or draw custom polygons, adjust their physical properties via input fields and sliders, connect bodies with constraints, and see a visual representation of the physics world.

## User Experience Goals

- Intuitive visual editing.
- Real-time feedback (potentially a simulation preview).
- Streamlined workflow for exporting configurations.
- Easy integration with existing Phaser projects.
