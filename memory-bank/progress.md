# Project Progress

## What Works

- Project workspace initialized.
- Defined Project Structure (including dedicated `src/editor/` directory).
- Core Entities Defined (`src/entities/` contains Player, Platforms, Enemies, Crates, Barrels, FinishLine, etc.).
- Agreed Level Data Format (JSON).
- **Level Editor Basics:**
  - Separate editor launch via `pnpm run editor`.
  - `EditorScene` implemented with camera controls (pan/zoom) and graphics-based grid.
  - UI Components (`Palette`, `Inspector`, `Toolbar`) created and integrated.
  - Entity placement (snapped to grid).
  - Entity selection with visual feedback.
  - Property inspection and editing via `Inspector` (Platform properties editable, Enemy type read-only).
  - **Platform Handling:**
    - Platforms created using the actual `Platform` class.
    - `segmentCount` and `isVertical` modification supported (recreates platform).
  - **Enemy Handling:**
    - Separate placement of `EnemyLarge` and `EnemySmall` using their classes.
    - Fixed EnemyLarge and EnemySmall classes to include required 'type' property.
  - Level Save/Load functionality implemented using JSON format (saves/loads specific enemy types).
  - **Entity Data:**
    - Fixed entity interface implementations to include all required properties.
    - Different interfaces have different requirements:
      - `PlatformInterface`: Requires `scene`, `id`, `x`, `y`, `segmentCount`, `isVertical`
      - `EnemyInterface`: Only requires `x`, `y`, `type` (no `scene` property)
      - `CrateInterface`: Requires `scene`, `x`, `y`, `type`
      - `BarrelInterface`: Requires `scene`, `x`, `y`
      - `FinishLineInterface`: Requires `scene`, `x`, `y`
  - **Level Data Management:**
    - Improved serialization/deserialization with separate interfaces to avoid circular references.
    - Created `SerializedPlatform`, `SerializedEnemy`, etc. interfaces for JSON storage.
    - Properly handles non-serializable properties like `scene` during save/load.
  - **Code Cleanup:**
    - Fixed unused variable warnings in EditorScene.ts
    - Properly handled event parameters in wheel and pointer events
    - Removed unused entityDragStartX and entityDragStartY variables
  - **Editor Layering:**
    - `EditorScene` uses `platformLayer` and `entityLayer` (Phaser Layers).
    - Entities correctly added to respective layers during placement and loading.
    - Selection logic iterates through layers.
    - Save logic (`LevelDataManager.saveLevel`) updated to accept and process lists from layers.
  - **Editor UI Refactor:**
    - `Palette`, `Inspector`, `Toolbar` instantiated with config objects.
    - Event callbacks (selection, property change, save, load) handled via constructor arguments.
  - **Editor Entity Deletion:**
    - Pressing `DELETE` or `BACKSPACE` key deletes the currently selected object.
    - **Confirmed:** Handled in `EditorScene`'s `setupInput`, calling `handleDeleteKeyPressed` which triggers `deleteSelectedObject`. This method removes the object from its layer (`platformLayer` or `entityLayer`) and deselects it.

## What's Left to Build

- **Game Integration:**
  - Modify the `Game.ts` scene to load levels from the editor's JSON format.
  - Remove all procedural generation code (`LevelGenerator.ts` likely removed or heavily repurposed).
  - Instantiate entities (Platforms, Enemies, Items) based on loaded JSON data, including correct enemy types.
  - Repurpose `LevelGenerator.ts` to _only_ handle coin placement. Modify its logic to place coins on loaded platforms, skipping platforms that contain enemies or crates based on the loaded JSON data.
  - Ensure death zones, crate respawning, etc., work correctly with loaded levels.
- **Editor Refinements:**
  - Implement object dragging/movement for selected entities.
  - Consider Undo/Redo functionality.
  - Improve Inspector UI (e.g., enable enemy type changing - requires recreation).
  - Add visual validation or feedback (e.g., if trying to place overlapping objects).
- **Testing:**
  - Test editor functionality thoroughly (placement, selection, properties, save/load).
  - Test game playing various levels created with the editor (once integration is done).
- **Game Mechanics Adaptation:**
  - Adapt existing game mechanics (Player movement, Physics, Restart Flow, Death Zones) to work seamlessly with manually loaded levels.
- **Clean up remaining compiler errors:**
  - Fix `src/editor/ui/Inspector.ts` unused createTextInput method
  - Fix `src/lib/level-generation/LevelGenerator.ts` missing/unused CrateSmall import
  - Fix `src/scenes/Game.ts` non-existent CrateBig import
- **Fix Linter Errors:** Address remaining "Module not found" and property access errors in `EditorScene.ts` and `LevelDataManager.ts` (likely requires verifying/fixing file paths, exports, or TS config).
- **Improve Inspector/Scene Type Handling:** Resolve inconsistencies between `EditorEntity` (Inspector) and `GameObject` (Scene) - potentially by standardizing types or improving the mapping function (`findEditorEntityForGameObject`).

## Current Status

- **Complete:**

  - Basic game mechanics (player movement, jumping, collisions)
  - Editor structure including EditorScene with Grid/UI components (Palette, Inspector, Toolbar)
  - Basic entity placement (snapped to grid) with visual representation and selection
  - Property editing for platforms (segment count, orientation) that updates visuals
  - JSON-based level data structure with save/load capability
  - `PlatformTool` and `PlatformPanel` for platform configuration
  - Special handling for platforms that require pre-placement configuration (segments, orientation)

- **In Progress:**

  - Enabling the game to load levels created with the editor
  - Adapting core game mechanics to work with manually created levels
  - Implementing coin placement on platforms loaded from JSON
  - Refining editor controls (entity dragging)
  - Stabilizing editor code (addressing linter errors, type handling).

- **Not Started:**
  - Undo/redo capability in the editor
  - Level picker in the game
  - Gameplay progression system
  - Mobile control optimizations

## Additional Notes

- **Platform implementation:** Platforms can now be configured with segment count and orientation before placement.
- **Entity management:** Each entity type is now correctly handled with its own placement and editing logic.
- **Workflow:** Entity selection, placement, and property editing create a complete level design workflow.
- **Progress focus:** The next focus is loading saved levels into the game and adapting game mechanics.

## Known Issues

- Entity dragging/movement in the editor is not yet implemented.
- Platform property changes cause a full recreation, potentially losing instance-specific state if any existed (currently none).
- Changing Enemy type via Inspector is not yet implemented (requires recreation logic).
- There are still a few TypeScript compiler errors in files outside of EditorScene.ts that need to be addressed.
- Persistent "Module not found" errors for various entity and lib imports in `EditorScene.ts` and `LevelDataManager.ts`.
- Linter errors regarding property access (`x`, `y`) on `GameObject` in `EditorScene.ts` despite `as any` casts.
- Potential type inconsistencies between `EditorScene` (`GameObject`) and `Inspector` (`EditorEntity`).

## Evolution of Decisions

- **Major Pivot:** Shifted from procedural level generation to a manual level editor as the primary method for creating game content.
- **JSON Data Format:** Defined a specific JSON structure for storing level data.
- **Code Structure:** Introduced a dedicated `src/editor/` directory.
- **Retained Mechanics:** Core gameplay systems (physics, controls, restart) will be adapted for manually designed levels.
- **Editor Grid:** Implemented using Phaser Graphics API instead of image assets.
- **Platform Implementation:** Refactored editor to use the actual `Platform` entity class instead of manual rendering or ghosts, improving consistency with the game.
- **Enemy Implementation:** Refactored editor to differentiate and use `EnemyLarge` and `EnemySmall` classes.
- **Entity Data Consistency:** Ensured all entity data objects include all required properties from their respective interfaces, noting the differences between interfaces.
- **Serialization Strategy:** Created dedicated interfaces for serialized data to avoid circular references and properly handle instance reconstruction.
- **Code Quality:** Improved TypeScript compliance by fixing linter errors and unused variables.
- **Editor Rendering:** Adopted Phaser Layers for managing platforms separately from other entities.
- **UI Component Interaction:** Shifted from event listeners (`.on()`) to passing callbacks during UI component construction.
- **Entity Deletion Trigger:** Implemented via keyboard input (`DELETE`/`BACKSPACE`) in the editor scene.

- The codebase is now more maintainable with smaller, focused components
- Event-driven communication simplifies component interaction

## Known Issues

- Some TypeScript typing issues may need attention
- UI components still need refactoring
- The main editor scene needs to be updated to use the new component architecture

## Next Steps

2. Update the main editor scene to use the new components
3. Ensure proper event handling between all components
4. Implement comprehensive cleanup methods

## Design Evolution

Initially, the editor was implemented with large, monolithic classes that handled multiple responsibilities. We've now shifted to a more modular, component-based approach with:

- Specialized entity components with clear responsibilities
- Centralized event system for cross-component communication
- Registry-based state sharing
- Clean separation of concerns
- Improved code organization and maintainability

This architecture:

- Improves maintainability
- Makes adding new features easier
- Reduces merge conflicts
- Enhances code readability

## Next Features

1. Complete UI component refactoring
2. Implement undo/redo system
3. Add additional entity types support (if needed)
4. Enhance visual feedback during editing
